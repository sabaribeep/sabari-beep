Yes why you need to type
exec or ./filename to run a file always in linux

Simple trick (not for geek )

store you executable file in these folder
  user/bin/
after these just type name of the file :)

otherwise add PATH in bash.bashrc termux file
#open file
nano /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/bash.bashrc
#type in the file
export PATH=$PATH:/place/to/the/file
